<h1>Linux kernel system calls for all architectures</h1>
    <p>
    The Linux kernel provides many system calls for userspace. However, the
    numbers used for them differ between architectures. This page was created
    to help developers find those values.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, there is another issue. Some of the system calls were dropped
    during Linux development, while some were replaced by newer ones. Several
    architectures were added into the kernel later and their maintainers
    decided not to bother with supporting obsolete system calls. They are
    marked with "-1" value in the table below.
    </p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>There are a few features you can use:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the search field allows you to filter the table by syscall name or number</li>
        <li>the system call names link to their man pages</li>
        <li>the 'disable architectures' button allows you to disable unneeded columns</li>
        <li>clicking on header entries sorts the table</li>
        <li>columns can be reordered by dragging the column header</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Some notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>the table is updated at random moments &mdash; usually somewhere after the rc1 kernel release</li>
        <li>old data is used for architectures removed from the Linux kernel (everything from avr32 to the end of the table)</li>
        <li>system calls specific to removed architectures were dropped</li>
        <li>system calls listed in <code>man 2 unimplemented</code> are not listed</li>
        <li>there is now a Python module for querying this data: "system_calls"</li>
    </ul>
